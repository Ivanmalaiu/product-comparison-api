> For a simple NestJS project that exposes a REST API (e.g., for comparing products), is it worth implementing a hexagonal architecture, or is a layered architecture sufficient? What are the pros and cons of each approach?

> Help me create unit tests, integration tests and e2e tests for a simple NestJS REST API that compares products by IDs. The data is stored in a local JSON file, and it throws a NotFoundException if any product ID is invalid.

> I have a NestJS controller that receives a DTO with an array of product IDs. I want to validate that each value is a UUID and the array is not empty. What's the correct way to use class-validator decorators for that?

> Help me write the README documentation for a NestJS API project that compares products. It should include an explanation of the architecture used, main endpoints, setup and test instructions, and any key decisions made during development.

> How would you change this repository so the products are not loaded and parsed each time.
